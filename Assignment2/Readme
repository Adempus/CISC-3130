This program assumes that a hardware company has warehouses in 5 cities: New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, and Chicago. In each warehouse, the company stocks three items. A record contains the amount of each item currently in each warehouse.
The record should contain an array of 5 warehouses with the name of each warehouse, and an array of the 3 items with the amout that is currently in stock in that warehouse.
Initially the warehouses are empty. Read in a card containing the three prices of the three items. Then read in cards which may be one of two types:

1) Shipment cards containing...
    S   city    amt1    amt2    amt3
    
This data represents a shipment to a given city of amt1 of item1, amt2 of item2 and amt3 of item3.

2) Order cards containing...
    O   city    amt1    amt2    amt3
This data represents an order in a given city of the respective amounts of the various items.

As each shipment card is read in, print it out, then update the amounts in each warehouse and then print on the next line:

    city    amt1    amt2    amt3
    
As each order card is read in, print it out. If there is enough in stock at that warehouse of each item, update the amounts.
If there is not enough, seach the other warehouses for the one which has the most of that particular item. Ship the amount 
needed from one warehouse to the other printing out:

    x of item Y shipped from city1 to city2
    and
    city1   amt1    amt2   amt3
  
10% extra is to be charged for any item shipped from one city to another. If no single warehouse has enough extra to fill the
order for a particular item, print out: 
    
    Order unfilled.
    
However, any shipments of the previous items remain in effect. 
In either case, print out the adjusted...

    city    amt1    amt2    amt3
    
And if the order is filled, print...
    
    Price of order: $xx,xxx.xx
