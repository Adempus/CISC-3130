Create a binary search tree in a language of your choice.
The tree class you create must have methods defined for:

    Inserting and deleting a value.
    Pre, in, and post order traversals.
    Finding a value.
    Counting the numebr of nodes in the tree (the tree's size)
    Counting the number of levels in the tree.
    Retrieving the number children, the parent, and the level of a node.  
    Freeing all the values of a tree.
    
The program should read in sets of random numbers from a file, and create a binary tree for each set.
Also, construct an interactive menu that allows the binary search tree operations to be performed by the user on the set of trees. 

** Extra credit **
Make your binary tree capable of processing all primitive types (not just ints), or objects of natural ordering.
