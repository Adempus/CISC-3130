The "XYZ Widget Store" recieves shipments of widgets at various costs. The store's policy is to charge a 20% markup, and to sell widgets which were recieved earlier before widgers which were recieved later.
Write a program using linked lists that reads in 3 types of input data and does the following:

    A sales record which contains an "S" in column 1, and a quantity which represents the number of widgets sold.
    
    A reciept record which contains an "R" incolumn 1 and a quantity and a price which represents the reciept of a quantity of widgets
    at the stated cost per widget.
    
    A promotion card which contains a "P" in column 1 and a number such as 25 which would represent a 25% discount to the next 2 buying 
    customers (the next 2 sales cards)
    
The program should...
    Print a message after each reciept record is read in with the price of the widigets recieved.
    Print a message after each promotion card is read in with the amount of discount the nest two customers willbe recieving.
    
    After a sales record is read in, print a message stating the number sold and the price of each order. For example, if 200 widgets
    were sold and there were 50 widges at $1.00 and 100 widgets at $2.00 and 50 widges at $3.00 print (recall the 30% markup policy)
      
      200 Widgets sold
      50  at  1.30 each   Sales: $65.00
      100 at  2.60 each   Sales: $260.00
      50  at  3.90 each   Sales: $195.00
                    Total Sales: $520.00
                    
    If there are insufficient number of widgers in stock to fill an order, sell as many as are available and then print:
      
      "remainder of xxx Widgers not available"
      
    Don't forget the promotional discount
At the end of the data before exiting the program, print out the widgets still left in stock, and their original purchase price.
