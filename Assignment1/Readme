You are to write a program for a hardware company's Accounts Recievable department (A/R are accounts that own money to the company because 
they have purchaced items and have not yet paid for them.) 

There are two types of input data:

1) A master file in ascending order by customer number (customer numbers are 4 digits long). The file also contains a 20 characrer name and a balance due.

2) Transaction file that contains records of each transaction. This file is also in ascending order by customer number. There should be more than one transaction record per master record. Each related group of data in a file is called a record. A record should be stored in astructure.
    
Each record starts with a character "O" for order or "P" for paymernt. Each record also contains te four digit number, a four digit transaction 
number, and up to three more values.

If the code is "O", the record contains the item ordered (20 characters), the quantity ordered (an integer) plus the cost of the item 
(You must multiply to get the total cost.)

If the code is "P", the record contains the amount of the payment. 

You are to read in records one at a time from the two files and use the transaction file recors to update the master file. Process all 
transaction records for each master record before going on to the nest master record. If the transaction record contains an "O" in column
1, calculate the order amount and add it to the balance due. If the reocrd contains a "P" in column 1, subtract the payment from the 
balance due. Keep a running total of the A/R balance of ABC company (that is the sum of balances due for each customer)

Your program should:
Check for errors such a duplicate master records, or records in the transaction file that do not appear in the master file. 

After processing a master record and all of its transaction, the program should prepare an invoice for each customer which lists the
customer name, number, previous balance (balance before transcations were performed), all tranactions, and the final balance due.
